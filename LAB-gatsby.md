=============================================================

## Before you begin
* Create an account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* Create a new repository for your work

## Overview
React is great, but it's a client-side application, which has a negative impact on SEO -- only an empty div is actually ever sent to the browser, and your React app fills in the content on the fly.

For content driven sites, such as a Blog or a news site, where its important to have search engines like Google and Bing  properly index your site, you must render full HTML on the server side and send all of that content to the browser.

## Assignment
Create a 2 page interactive with the **Gatsby** framework and deploy it to Netlify 

* Use the same template/layout for both pages
  * Header with site title and navigation
    * Home links to the home page
    * Counter links to the counter page
  * Body section with content for the page
  * Footer with contact information (email, phone, twitter link)
* Home Page (/)
  * Body section should have a title (your name)
  * Include images, links to projects, your why, etc.
* Counter Page (/counter)
  * Yet another counter!
